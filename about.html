		<h1>Guy, Kokujin</h1>
		<!-- Article Subtitle -->
		<p>I started this website as a means of documenting my travel and experiences while in East Asia, as well as any insights or opinions on current Japanese affairs. As a DJ and a big photography enthusiast, the main reason for this site is as a photo and music portfolio. Additionally, any events that are going on in Tokyo that I feel might be of interest can be found on the Events section of this site, with details of any discounts and deals that might be available.
		</p>
		<p>I lived in Tokyo for 5 years; beginning with a year of study abroad at Chuo University for my 3rd year of undergraduate study at The University of Manchester, before going on to a working holiday in Japan - followed by a spell of employment here.
		Being a British guy of African descent comes with a fair few challenges in Tokyo, and I hope to share some of these experiences, tribulations, and advice with anyone that will listen!</p>
